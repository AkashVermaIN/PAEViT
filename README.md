# PAEViT

First, either download the github repository directly as a zip file and extract it, or clone it using the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/AkashVermaIN/PAEViT

Once done, you should have a folder named PAEViT containing all the required files to start training. However, you still need to install the prerequisites such as PyTorch and other modules if you don't usually perform similar tasks. To do this, you can simply go inside the PAEViT folder, then right click on any blank space and click "Open in Terminal", then run the following command (or just change directory inside existing terminal session to make sure you're in the PAEViT folder):

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once done, you should simply be able to double click on the run file inside the PAEViT folder, then execute any of the training configurations. 

You can also change the 'custom.py' file inside the models folder to try out different things, and you should be able to run the same. All the results will be stored inside a 'CheckpointResults' folder inside the PAEViT directory, which you can check out once the expirements are completed.
